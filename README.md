# Buffer Overflow Assistant
## What is this
This was built to assist with Windows Buffer Overflows, primarily for the OSCP.
## What it does
This provides a menu with options from 1-9 which allow you to execute certain tasks.  
Example - fire a for loop of A's to find out how many crash the service.  
Example - send bad characters, you can then manually check to see what needs to be removed
Example - utilises patternCreate to find the offset value.
## How to Use
The script will need modifying, there sections that need to be modified are commented out in the script. This is typically where the unique PoC causing the overflow will need to be written to.]
